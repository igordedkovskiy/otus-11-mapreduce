A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering
and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for
each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as
counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies).
The MapReduce System (also called infrastructure or framework) orchestrates
the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various
tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the
various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.
